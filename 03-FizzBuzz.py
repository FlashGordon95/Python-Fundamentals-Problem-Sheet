#Create a list of numbers up to 100 and then iterate over it 
for x in range(100):
    if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
     print('FizzBuzz');
    
    elif x % 3 == 0: # If number is multiple of 3 but not 5
        print('Fizz');
    elif x % 5 == 0: # If number is multiple of 5 but not 3
        print('Buzz');
    else:
        print(str(x))
